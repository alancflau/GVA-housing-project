## Overview
This project aims to gather data through web scraping for the Greater Vancouver Area, conduct data exploration, develop predictive models, and ultimately predict housing prices in the region. The Greater Vancouver Area is known for its diverse real estate market and fluctuating housing prices, making it an interesting area for analysis and prediction.

## Contents
Web Scraping: The project involves scraping data from various sources such as real estate websites, government databases, and other relevant platforms to gather comprehensive information about properties in the Greater Vancouver Area.

Data Exploration: Once the data is collected, thorough exploration and analysis will be conducted to understand the underlying patterns, trends, and relationships within the dataset. This exploration will involve statistical analysis, visualization, and other techniques to gain insights into the housing market dynamics.

Modeling: Predictive modeling techniques will be applied to develop models that can accurately forecast housing prices in the Greater Vancouver Area. Machine learning algorithms such as regression, random forests, or neural networks may be employed to build robust models.

Housing Prediction: The ultimate goal of the project is to leverage the developed models to predict housing prices for different properties in the Greater Vancouver Area. These predictions can provide valuable insights for buyers, sellers, and investors in the real estate market.

## Usage
Web Scraping: Execute the web scraping scripts provided in the repository to gather data from relevant sources. Make sure to adhere to the terms of use and guidelines of the websites being scraped.

Data Exploration: Use Jupyter Notebook or any preferred IDE to run the data exploration scripts. Analyze the collected data, visualize it using appropriate plots, and extract insights to understand the housing market dynamics.

Modeling: Utilize the collected data to train predictive models. Experiment with different algorithms, tune hyperparameters, and evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics.

Housing Prediction: Once the models are trained and validated, use them to make predictions on housing prices for new data points. Evaluate the predictions and refine the models if necessary.
